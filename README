Responsive web design (RWD)
Mobile first, unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement based on browser-, device-, or feature-detection

Unobtrusive JavaScript
1. [Separation] [Usability] To separate JavaScript from HTML markup, as well as keeping modules of JavaScript independent of other modules.
2. [Graceful degradation] Unobtrusive JavaScript should degrade gracefully - all content should be available without all or any of the JavaScript running successfully.
3. [Accessibility] Unobtrusive JavaScript should not degrade the accessibility of the HTML, and ideally should improve it, whether the user has personal disabilities or are using an unusual, or unusually configured, browser.
